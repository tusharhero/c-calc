* C-calc
A Calculator written in C.
* Specs
It will only work for basic arithmetic operators like, =+=, =-= , =*=, =/=.
* Algorithm
We will ask the user for the expression they want to evaluate.
Let's say its some thing simple, like,
$$ 5 + 2 - 1$$
Which would be a string in our code, =5 + 2 - 1=. We will ignore any
spaces or white space. Hence, our user inputted string would become,
=5+2-1=. After this, we will need to identify the operators? And then
the operands for them.
** Finding the operators.
Using =strtok= function, find the places where we have, the operators.
